The plan in here is to make RL integrated planning algorithm (D-lite) so that we improve the motion planning decision capabilities of mobile robots.
The project inlcudes implementation of D_lite and then implementing RL strategies to improve the planning. 
I then plan to simulate the project using Rviz to check for the following factors 
- Path optimality
- Time taken
- Essentially when a mobile robot is placed in a different environmnets
- Path stability
- Reorientation
